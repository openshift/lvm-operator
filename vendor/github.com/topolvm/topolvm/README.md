# TopoLVM

TopoLVM is a [CSI][] plugin using LVM for Kubernetes.
It can be considered as a specific implementation of [local persistent volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) using CSI and LVM.

- **Conformed CSI version**: [1.5.0](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/v1.5.0/spec.md)

Our supported platform are:

- Kubernetes: 1.28, 1.27, 1.26
- Node OS: Linux with LVM2 (\*1)
- CPU Architecture: x86 (\*2), arm64 (\*3), ppc64le (\*3)
- Filesystems: ext4, xfs, btrfs(experimental)
- lvm version 2.02.163 or later (adds JSON output support)

\*1 The host's Linux Kernel must be v4.9 or later which supports `rmapbt` and `reflink`, if you use xfs filesystem with an official docker image.  
\*2 Tier1 support. The official docker images are provided and all functionalities are tested by CI.  
\*3 Tier2 support. The official docker images are provided, but no tests run by CI.  
\*4 Tier3 support. No docker images are provided, and no tests run by CI, but binaries are built.

Docker images are available on [ghcr.io](https://github.com/orgs/topolvm/packages).  

## Getting Started

If you want to try TopoLVM on your local machine, see [example](example/) directory which provides scripts to run TopoLVM on [kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)][kind].

To use TopoLVM on your real kubernetes cluster, read [documents](docs/README.md).

Deprecated: If you want to use TopoLVM on [Rancher/RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/), see [docs/deprecated/rancher/README.md](docs/deprecated/rancher/README.md).

## Scope

### In Scope

- [Dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/external-provisioner.html): Volumes are created dynamically when `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects are created.
- [Raw block volume](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/raw-block.html): Volumes are available as block devices inside containers.
- [Topology](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/topology.html): TopoLVM uses CSI topology feature to schedule Pod to Node where LVM volume exists.
- Extended scheduler: TopoLVM extends the general Pod scheduler to prioritize Nodes having larger storage capacity.
- Volume metrics: Usage stats are exported as Prometheus metrics from `kubelet`.
- [Volume Expansion](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/volume-expansion.html): Volumes can be expanded by editing `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects.
- [Storage capacity tracking](https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm/tree/main/deploy#storage-capacity-tracking): You can enable Storage Capacity Tracking mode instead of using topolvm-scheduler.
- [Snapshot](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-restore-feature.html): Snapshots can be taken when using thin provisioning.

### Planned Features

- Prioritize based on volume capacity without using the extended scheduler.

## Communications
